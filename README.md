# Project 0- Jimmy's coffee

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

The project how first practice of course contains 4 page html, is like a coffe bar with list of drinks, drinks with prices and images (I found that the name exist obviusly):

- Index.html: It is the main page of website, where in H1 use the class specificMessage that is inheritance of message. Also use the components buttons of BootStrap that is clicked, you can navigate by the other pages. Moreover I use the the id margin that call #margin from .css.

- List.html: In list page, you can see the list and the breadcrumb components of bootstrap, for return to the home page. H3 is inheritance of message also, and I use the circle in style of ul.

- Table.html: In this page, as I linked the bootstrap for style improve the style also use breadcrumb, H3 and in the table use class centerCell in <tr> 

- Image.html: These page is where I use grid. I split the first row in diferente column that include the name and picture with a coherent size. For the second row I want centralize the text and img. Also include the breadcrumb for easy navigation inside the web.

- SCSS/CSS: I was developing first in css, but finally I use SCSS for apply the style and variables, etc. in all website. In this file there are, class, id, variables, nesting, inheritance. I think that include all the requirements for this project.
